# Second Sun

Second Sun is a Chrome extension written to protect your precious eyes while watching videos.

The extension performs a search per page for video elements when loaded. A toggle button and canvas attaches to the video player.
Attachment details vary depending whether the player is recognized(YouTube, for instance) or not.
Each video frame, after image manipulation, is displayed on the aforementioned canvas driven by WebGL.
